## How to use

The simplest way to use this image set is to use [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)'s CDN service:
```html
<img width="40" height="40" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/s9e/emoji-assets-twemoji/dist/svgz/1f929.svgz">
```
You can read about the scheme used for filenames in [the section below](#differences-from-twemoji) .


## How to build

You will need Bash, npm and zopfli installed. Run `scripts/init.sh` to install git submodules and svgo, then run 
`scripts/build.sh` to rebuild the files in the `dist` directory. The process is single threaded and will take several minutes.


## Assets

Images in the `dist` directory are derived from the [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) images.

Filenames have been normalized and the SVG content has been minified with [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo/) before being compressed with [zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli).


## License

## Differences from Twemoji

- SVG content has been minified with SVGO.
- SVG files have been compressed with zopfli to produce SVGZ files.
- Filenames have been normalized to use 4- and 5- digits hex values, and exclude `200f` and `fe0f`. For instance, the image named `a9.svg` in Twemoji is available as `00a9.svgz` in this repository.
